# DenoiseTimeSeries - A quick analysis in frequency domain to smooth your time series data in python!

 
Wit Denoise, you can quickly analyze and visualize the fast fourier transform of your time series data with python in just few lines of code. Just read the time series data collected at equal time intervals and specify the final time (# of datapoints * sample time) and the sample time, and the rest is done for you.

# Overview
The Denoise Python package was written to improve the time in analyzing the time series data in frequency domain and understand the significant frequency components in data. It provides the following key features

  - Visualize the noise data
  - Calculate fft, power spectral density (PSD)
  - Plot PSD
  - Calculate the cleaned time series
  - Plot the cleaned time series data


## Usage

In the following paragraphs, I am going to describe how you can get and use Denoise for your own projects.

###  Getting it

To download distributions, fork this github repo. 

### Using it

Denoise was programmed with ease-of-use in mind. First, import Denoisefft from Denoise

```Python
from Denoise import Denoisefft
```

And you are ready to go! At this point, I want to clearly explain Denoisefft class 

## Initialize a Denoisefft object
array is the time series value data
tf is the final time in seconds at which data logging was stopped
dt is the sample time - the interval between two observations

```Python
denoise_one=Denoisefft(array,tf,dt)
```

## Calculate fast fourier transform and power spectrum density
The class Denoisefft has a method PSD to calculate the fast fourier transform, PSD, and visualize the noisy data and
power spectrum density to understand the significant components of the time series data.

```Python
denoise_one.PSD()

```
#### Denoise the time series data
Using the power spectral density plot identify the cut off amplitude for the components in the time series data.

```Python
denoise_one.denoise()
```
